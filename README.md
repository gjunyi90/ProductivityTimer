# ProductivityTimer

A Simple Productivity Timer App created for personal time management.

## Motivation

Basically there are two timers:
1) One to countdown to the end of the Work Day.
  - This will be a timer for managing daily goals.
2) Another to countdown 30 minutes repeatedly.
  - This 30 minutes is also sort of adopted from Pomodoro Technique.
  - Pomodoro Technique suggests working for 25 minutes and resting for 5 minutes.
  - This removes the hassle of pressing the timer every time.

## Packages

- Tkinter
- Datetime
